# Kingdom Hearts Launchers
Simple and Clean launchers for Kingdom Hearts 1.5+2.5 and Kingdom Hearts 2.8.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is only compatible with the Steam releases. Due to the nature of how Epic Games version works, these launchers cannot be made compatible with it.

## Features
- Launching games (holy shit)
- Not having Disney and Square Enix copyright screens on launch
- Launching Melon Mix instead of game's movie implementations of 358/2 Days and Re:coded (also a workaround because normal movies are embedded into the launcher)
- Best game orders available, such as alphabetical and reverse chronological (i want to see a marathon with alphabetical 2 reverse)

## 1.5 Launcher

Just replace the `KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX.exe` executable (it doesn't do anything meaningful anyway).

## 2.8 Launcher
